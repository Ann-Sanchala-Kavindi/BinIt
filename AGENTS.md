## 2. Source-of-Truth Hierarchy

Before making code modifications in any component, developers and agents **MUST** consult documentation in this strict order:

1. **`AGENTS.md`**: Mandatory constraints, scope discipline, and testing protocols.
2. **`docs/architecture.md`**: System topology, component boundaries, and AI governance.
3. **`docs/database-schema.md`**: Authoritative entity definitions, relations, enums, and indexes.
4. **`docs/api-contract.md`**: Frozen endpoints, HTTP methods, payloads, and status codes.
5. **Existing Codebase Implementation**: Current source code patterns and conventions.

> [!CAUTION]
> If implementation and source-of-truth documentation disagree, do not silently choose one. Report the conflict unless the current task explicitly authorizes a contract change. For an authorized change, update the relevant documentation and implementation together.

---

## 3. Scope & Change Discipline

- **Task Isolation**: Modify **only** files strictly necessary to satisfy the assigned task.
- **No Speculative Abstractions**: Implement only what is required. Keep solutions straightforward, maintainable, and defensible in an academic viva setting.
- **No Unsolicited Refactoring**: Do not reformat or refactor unrelated files, variable names, or existing passing tests.
- **Frozen Contracts**: Do not rename entities, table columns, routes, or enum values without explicit contractual agreement.
- **Dependency Guard**: Do not introduce new NuGet, npm, pub, or pip packages without explicit project approval.

---

## 4. Git & Version Control Rules for Agents

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise:
- **NO `git commit`**: Never create git commits autonomously.
- **NO `git push`**: Never push changes to remote repositories.
- **NO branch manipulation**: Do not create, switch, delete, or merge branches.
- **Local Working Tree Only**: Apply all modifications strictly to the local working directory.
- **Audit Trail**: Clearly report all created, modified, or deleted files in the final task output.

---

## 5. Backend Development Rules (`/backend`)

- **Authoritative Gateway**: ASP.NET Core is the **sole** authoritative backend. It controls database access, business rules, and security.
- **Layer Separation**:
  - `SmartWaste.Api`: Controllers, HTTP mapping, middleware, Swagger.
  - `SmartWaste.Application`: Use cases, DTOs, validations, service interfaces.
  - `SmartWaste.Domain`: Entities, enums, domain invariants (no external dependencies).
  - `SmartWaste.Infrastructure`: EF Core, PostgreSQL mappings, Identity, external/AI HTTP clients.
- **API Standards**:
  - Prefix: Always preserve `/api/v1`.
  - JSON Casing: Always use `camelCase`.
  - Error Handling: Always return standard RFC 7807 `ProblemDetails`.
- **Validation**: Business rules and data validation must reside in application services or FluentValidation validators, **never** solely in controller action methods.
- **Dependency Injection**: Use typed clients (`AddHttpClient<TInterface, TImpl>()`) and strongly typed options (`IOptions<TOptions>`).

---

## 6. Database & Migration Rules

- **Single Database**: Exactly one PostgreSQL database, managed via a single `AppDbContext`.
- **Authoritative Migrations**: All schema modifications **MUST** be executed via EF Core migrations (`dotnet ef migrations add`). Never edit the production schema directly.
- **Migration Ownership**: Only one migration should be generated per conceptual schema milestone. Multiple agents must not independently create overlapping migrations.
- **Data Integrity**: Enforce foreign keys, unique constraints, and UTC timestamps (`timestamptz`).

---

## 7. Web Application Rules (`/web`)

- **Sole Communication Target**: React connects **only** to ASP.NET Core (`http://localhost:5276/api/v1` or configured `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).
- **Never Call FastAPI**: React must **NEVER** call the Python AI service directly.
- **Client Discipline**: Do not duplicate authoritative server-side business rules on the client. UI checks are for UX only; backend validates authoritatively.
- **Centralized API Client**: Use the established `axiosClient` with Bearer token interceptor and standard token storage.

---

## 8. Mobile Application Rules (`/mobile`)

- **Sole Communication Target**: Flutter connects **only** to ASP.NET Core.
- **Never Call FastAPI**: Flutter must **NEVER** call the Python AI service directly.
- **Secure Storage**: JWT access tokens must be stored strictly in hardware-backed `FlutterSecureStorage`.
- **Configurable Networking**: Preserve configurable base URLs via `ApiConstants` (`10.0.2.2:5276` for Android Emulator, `--dart-define=API_BASE_URL=...` for physical devices). Never hardcode personal LAN IP addresses into committed files.

---

## 9. AI Service & Agentic Governance (`/ai-service`)

- **Internal Microservice Only**: FastAPI is strictly private on `127.0.0.1:8000` (or private Docker network).
- **No Direct Database Access**: Python has **zero** direct connection to PostgreSQL.
- **No Authoritative Writes**: The AI service cannot commit operational changes. It returns structured proposals to ASP.NET Core.
- **Allow-Listed Tools**: Agents invoke only pre-registered tools with strongly validated schemas.
- **Deterministic Override**: Programmatic business rules in ASP.NET Core always override LLM recommendations.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: High-impact actions (dispatch, re-routing) require `MunicipalManager` approval before database commit.
- **Audit & Privacy**:
  - Never store hidden chain-of-thought tokens in the database.
  - Store structured inputs, tool calls, and summary results in `AiWorkflowStep` and `AiToolCall`.
- **Provider Isolation**: Do not configure external LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) until specifically instructed.

---

## 10. Testing & Verification Protocol

After implementing changes in any component, execute the corresponding test suite and report real outcomes:

| Subsystem | Required Verification Commands | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | `dotnet build backend/SmartWaste.sln`<br>`dotnet test backend/SmartWaste.sln` | 0 compilation errors, 0 warnings.<br>All unit and integration tests pass. |
| **Web** | `npm test` (or `npm run build` in `/web`) | Clean TypeScript compilation and test pass. |
| **Mobile** | `flutter analyze`<br>`flutter test` in `/mobile` | 0 analyzer issues, all widget/unit tests pass. |
| **AI Service** | `pytest tests` in `/ai-service` | All pytest test cases pass. |

> **Honesty Mandate:** Never claim tests passed unless they were physically executed with exit code 0.

---

## 11. Team Collaboration & Student Ownership

The system represents four distinct student modules coordinated under a shared foundation:

1. **Component 1**: Waste Reporting & Citizen Management
2. **Component 2**: Waste Collection & Bin Management
3. **Component 3**: Fleet, Driver & Route Management
4. **Component 4**: Operations, Complaints & Analytics

### Collaboration Protocol
- **Shared Files**: Exercise extreme care when modifying `AppDbContext.cs`, `Program.cs`, shared enums (`AppRoles`), migrations, or root configurations.
- **Feature Branches**: When collaborating on Git, use short-lived feature branches (`feat/comp1-reporting`, `feat/comp2-bins`).
- **Main Branch**: `main` must remain deployable, compiling, and tested at all times.

---

## 12. Coding Agent Final Reporting Requirement

At the conclusion of every automated agent task, provide a structured report containing:

1. **Files Created / Modified / Deleted**: Full relative paths.
2. **Functionality Implemented**: Concise summary of new capabilities.
3. **Verification Commands & Results**: Exact commands run with pass/fail counts and output summaries.
4. **Assumptions Made**: Technical choices made within the boundaries of the frozen specification.
5. **Unresolved Issues / Next Steps**: Open items or prerequisites for the next phase.
6. **Contract Integrity Check**: Explicit confirmation that all frozen contracts (`docs/`) were respected without unauthorized alterations.
